# Movie Trailer Website: Fresh Tomatoes

## About

This project provides a simple server-side script that stores a list of movies and generates a static web page that allows visitors to browse the movies and watch their trailers.

## Getting Started

To run the program, change the Terminal's directory to the root of the project's folder and run `python entertainment_center.py`. A file named **fresh_tomatoes.html** will be generated and opened in your default web browser.
